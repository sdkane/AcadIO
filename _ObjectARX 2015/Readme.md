These dll files are extracted from the AutoCAD Developers Network ObjectARX download.

Any version of the dll's should work if you are using an alternate version of ACAD.

The 2015 dlls are forwards compatible to 2019 which is as far as I have tested.
Unless there is a significant change to the way ACAD works this should continue to remain true.
